# Coffee-Machine
## Description
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. <br>
It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; <br>
but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. <br>
In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. <br>
The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. <br>
You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money. <br>

## Learning Outcomes
This project allows you to get a taste of Java. Challenge yourself with loops and conditions, practice working with classes, and get more confident in Java. <br>
## Stages
**Stage 1: Making Coffee**
<br> Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee! <br>
**Stage 2: Ingredient Calculator**
<br> Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee. <br>
**Stage 3: Estimate the number of servings**
<br> Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter. <br>
**Stage 4: Buy, Fill, Take**
<br> Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee <br>
**Stage 5: Keep Track of the Supplies**
<br> Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”. <br>
**Stage 6: Brush up your code**
<br> Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly. <br>
